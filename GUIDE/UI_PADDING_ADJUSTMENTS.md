# UI Padding Adjustments - No Hidden Text

## Problem Solved
The "Recent Stock Activity" and "Low Stock Alerts" titles were appearing too close to the list items, making text look hidden or cramped.

## Changes Made

### Panel Titles
**Before:**
- Font: 12F Bold
- Location: Point(20, 15)
- Size: (300, 25)
- Icon: 16px at Point(520, 18)

**After:**
- Font: 13F Bold (larger, more prominent)
- Location: Point(20, 18) (moved down 3px)
- Size: (300, 28) (increased height)
- Icon: 18px at Point(520, 20) (larger, better aligned)

### List Items Starting Position
**Before:**
- Items started at yPos = 50
- Item spacing = 35px

**After:**
- Items start at yPos = 58 (8px more space from title)
- Item spacing = 38px (3px more breathing room)

### Individual Item Height
**Before:**
- Panel height: 32px
- Elements positioned at y=6-8px

**After:**
- Panel height: 36px (4px taller)
- Elements positioned at y=8-10px (better vertical centering)

### Element Positioning Within Items

#### Activity Items:
- Icon: y=10 (was y=8)
- ID Badge: y=8 (was y=6)
- Name Label: y=9 (was y=7)
- Qty Label: y=9 (was y=7)
- Category Label: y=10 (was y=8)
- Time Label: y=10 (was y=8)

#### Alert Items:
- Icon: y=10 (was y=8)
- ID Badge: y=8 (was y=6)
- Name Label: y=9 (was y=7)
- Stock Badge: y=8 (was y=6)
- Supplier Label: y=10 (was y=8)
- Order Button: y=8 (was y=6)

### No Data Messages
**Before:**
- Location: Point(20, 50)
- Font: 9F Italic
- Size: (500, 20)

**After:**
- Location: Point(20, 58) (aligned with item start)
- Font: 9.5F Italic (slightly larger)
- Size: (500, 22) (more height)

## Visual Improvements

### Spacing Hierarchy
1. **Title to Content Gap**: 12px clear space (58 - 46 = 12px)
2. **Between Items**: 38px total (36px item + 2px gap)
3. **Within Items**: 8-10px from top edge

### Typography
- Titles: 13F Bold (more prominent)
- Item text: 9.5F Bold for names (better readability)
- Secondary text: 8.5F (clear hierarchy)

### Visual Balance
- All badges properly centered vertically
