## Migration Steps

### For Developers

1. **Database Migration:**
   ```sql
   -- Run the migration script
   sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER -d POSDB -i Database/AddInvoicingAndPaymentTables.sql
   ```

2. **Update References:**
   - Old POS views are deprecated but not deleted
   - New views are in `Views/CashierDashboard/` folder
   - MainDashboard.cs automatically routes cashiers to new interface

3. **Test Cashier Login:**
   - Login with cashier credentials
   - Verify new dashboard loads
   - Test POS transaction flow
   - Verify invoice creation

### For Users

1. **Login as usual** - No changes to login process
2. **New dashboard appears** - Familiarize yourself with metrics
3. **Click "Cashier (POS)"** - Access the new POS interface
4. **Follow new workflow:**
   - Select client
   - Add products
   - Adjust quantities
   - Pay with chosen method
   - Choose receipt delivery

## Backward Compatibility

### Admin & Inventory Clerk Roles
- **No changes** - These roles continue using existing interfaces
- Only Cashier and Manager roles see the new dashboard

### Existing Data
- All existing sales data preserved
- Products, customers, categories unchanged
- New invoice system runs alongside existing sales

### Old Views Status
- `Views/PointOfSaleView.cs` - Deprecated, can be removed
- `syncversestudio/Views/CashierDashboardView.cs` - Deprecated, can be removed
- Kept temporarily for reference

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cashier sees old dashboard
**Solution:** Check MainDashboard.cs routing, ensure new views are compiled

### Issue: Products don't show images
**Solution:** Images use placeholders with initials, this is expected behavior

### Issue: Payment fails
**Solution:** Verify database migration ran successfully, check Invoices table exists

### Issue: Charts don't display
**Solution:** Ensure System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting is referenced
