# POS System - Riel Payment Support & Sound Effects

## Overview
Enhanced the POS system with Khmer Riel (៛) cash payment support and automatic sound effects for payment completion.

## New Features

### 1. Dual Currency Cash Payment (USD & KHR)

#### Currency Selection
- Added radio buttons for currency selection when Cash payment is selected
- **USD ($)**: Default currency option
- **Riel (៛)**: Khmer Riel option for local currency payments

#### Smart Change Calculation
- Automatically calculates change in the same currency as payment
- Uses CurrencyService for accurate currency conversion
- Exchange Rate: 1 USD = 4,000 KHR
- Change is displayed with proper currency symbol

#### Payment Flow
1. Customer selects Cash payment method
2. Cashier selects currency (USD or Riel)
3. Cashier enters cash amount received
4. System automatically calculates change in same currency
5. Change is displayed: `$5.00` or `20,000 ៛`

### 2. Sound Effects

#### QR/Mobile Payment Sound
- **File**: `assets/audio/cash-register-kaching-376867.mp3`
- **Trigger**: When "Payment Received" button is clicked in QR payment dialog
- **Purpose**: Confirms successful mobile/QR payment

#### Invoice Completion Sound
- **File**: `assets/audio/cash-register-kaching-sound-effect-125042.mp3`
- **Trigger**: When invoice is successfully created and saved
- **Purpose**: Confirms successful sale completion

#### Sound Implementation
- Uses `System.Media.SoundPlayer` for audio playback
- Graceful failure if sound files are missing
- Non-blocking playback (doesn't freeze UI)
- Automatic cleanup on form closing

## Technical Implementation

### UI Changes

#### Payment Panel Layout
```
Payment Method:
○ Cash    ○ Card    ○ Mobile/QR

Currency:              (Visible only for Cash)
○ USD ($)
○ Riel (៛)

Cash Amount: [______]
Change: $0.00 or 0 ៛
```

### Code Changes

#### 1. New Fields
```csharp
private RadioButton rbCashUSD, rbCashKHR;
private Label lblCashCurrency;
private System.Media.SoundPlayer soundPlayer;
```

#### 2. Enhanced CalculateChange Method
```csharp
private void CalculateChange()
{
    // Determine payment currency
    var paidCurrency = rbCashUSD.Checked 
        ? CurrencyService.Currency.USD 
        : CurrencyService.Currency.KHR;
    
    // Calculate change in same currency
    var (changeAmount, changeCurrency) = CurrencyService.CalculateChange(
        total, cashAmount, paidCurrency, paidCurrency
    );
    
    // Format with proper symbol
    lblChange.Text = CurrencyService.Format(changeAmount, changeCurrency);
}
```

#### 3. Sound Playback Method
```csharp
private void PlaySound(string soundFile)
{
    string soundPath = Path.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, soundFile);
    if (File.Exists(soundPath))
    {
        soundPlayer = new System.Media.SoundPlayer(soundPath);
        soundPlayer.Play();
    }
}
```

#### 4. Sound Triggers
- **QR Payment**: In `ShowMobilePaymentDialog()` → `btnConfirm.Click`
- **Invoice Complete**: In `ProcessSale()` → After `SaveChangesAsync()`

### Currency Service Integration

The system uses the existing `CurrencyService` class which provides:
- **Convert()**: Convert between USD and KHR
- **Format()**: Format amount with currency symbol
- **CalculateChange()**: Calculate change with currency validation
- **FormatDual()**: Display both currencies (e.g., "$5.00 / 20,000៛")

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Cash Payment in USD
```
Total: $10.50
Payment: Cash (USD)
Cash Amount: $20.00
Change: $9.50
```

### Example 2: Cash Payment in Riel
```
Total: $10.50 (42,000៛)
Payment: Cash (Riel)
Cash Amount: 50,000៛
Change: 8,000៛
```

### Example 3: QR Payment
```
Total: $10.50
Payment: Mobile/QR
1. QR code displayed
2. Customer scans and pays
3. Cashier clicks "Payment Received"
4. Sound plays: cash-register-kaching-376867.mp3
5. Invoice created
6. Sound plays: cash-register-kaching-sound-effect-125042.mp3
```

Or for Riel:
